\details{
The calculated (values of) regime may be considered as representation of
 district heating process in conditions of hypothetically perfect
 technical state of pipe walls and insulation.

 They consider only simple tracing paths which do not contain rings and any
 kind of parallelization. At the same time bidirectional (forward and
 backward) tracing is possible in accordance with sensor position. They also
 may consider discharges to network at the inlet of each pipeline segment
 as an approximation of actual forks of flows. Relevant illustration of
 adopted assumptions for 4-segment tracing path is depicted on the next
 figure.

 \figure{m325regtrace.png}

 They make additional check for consistency of \code{inlet} and \code{outlet}
 values for subsequent pipe segments. Discrepancy of appropriate elevations
 cannot be more than \code{elev_tol}.

# Consider 4-segment tracing path depicted in ?m325regtrace help page.
# First, let sensor readings for forward tracing:
t_fw <- 130  # [째C]
p_fw <- .588399*all.equal(.588399, mpa_kgf(6))  # [MPa]
g_fw <- 250  # [ton/hour]

# Let discharges to network for each pipeline segment are somehow determined as
discharges <- seq(0, 30, 10)  # [ton/hour]

\donttest{
# Then the calculated regime (red squares) for forward tracing is
regime_fw <- m325traceline(t_fw, p_fw, g_fw, discharges, forward = TRUE)
