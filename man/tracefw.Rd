Trace values of thermal-hydraulic regime (temperature, pressure,

 user-provided values of \emph{specific heat loss power}.

\details{
They consider the topology of district heating network represented by
 \code{\link{m325testbench}}:

 \figure{tracefw.png}

 Tracing starts from sensor-equipped root node and goes forward, i.e along
 the flow direction. Function \code{\link{traceline}} serves under the
 hood for tracing identified linear segments from root node to every
 terminal node. Hence they only need root node to be equipped with sensors.
 Sensors at other nodes are redundant in forward tracing, since the tracing
 algorithm by no means consider them for tracing.

 Moreover in the forward tracing algorithm they assume the flow of heat
 carrier is distributed proportionally to the cross-sectional area of the
 outgoing pipeline. Actually, a lot of reasons may cause significant
 deviations from this assumption. As a result, the sequence of paired
 backward/forward tracing may be divergent for regime parameters.

 Though some input arguments are natively vectorized their individual values
 all relate to common part of district heating network, i.e. associated with
 common object. It is due to isomorphism between vector representation and
 directed graph of this network. For more details of isomorphic topology
 description see \code{\link{m325testbench}}.

 They are welcome to couple the algorithm with functionality of
 \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table}{data.table}.

# * avoid using numeric identifiers for nodes:

DHN$acceptor <- sprintf("N\%02i", DHN$acceptor)

# * alter units:
DHN$d <- 1e3 * DHN$d  # convert [m] to [mm]
