\title{Minenergo-325. Test bench of district heating network}
\format{
A data frame with 22 rows (number of nodes and incoming edges) and 15 variables:
\describe{
  \item{sender}{
    An identifier of node which heat carrier flows out.
    Type: any type that can be painlessly coerced to character
    by \code{\link{as.character}}.
  }

  \item{acceptor}{
    An identifier of node which heat carrier flows in. According to topology
    of test bench considered this identifier should be unique for every row.
    Type: any type that can be painlessly coerced to
    character by \code{\link{as.character}}.
  }

  \item{temperature}{
    Snapshot of thermal-hydraulic regime state: temperature of heat carrier (water)
    sensor-measured on acceptor node, [\emph{Â°C}]. Type: \code{[double]}.
    \code{NA}s are introduced for nodes without temperature sensor.
  }

  \item{pressure}{
    Snapshot of thermal-hydraulic regime state:
    sensor-measured
    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_measurement#Absolute}{absolute pressure}
    of heat carrier (water) inside the pipe (i.e. acceptor's incoming edge),
    [\emph{MPa}].
    Type: \code{[double]}. \code{NA}s are introduced for nodes without
    pressure sensor.
  }

  \item{consumption}{
    Snapshot of thermal-hydraulic regime state:
    sensor-measured amount of heat carrier (water) that is transferred by
    pipe (i.e. acceptor's incoming edge) during a period, [\emph{ton/hour}].
    Type: \code{[double]}. \code{NA}s are introduced for nodes without
    consumption sensor.
  }

 \item{d}{
   internal diameter of pipe (i.e.diameter of acceptor's incoming edge),
   [\emph{m}].
   Type: \code{[double]}.
 }

 \item{len}{
   pipe length (i.e. length of acceptor's incoming edge), [\emph{m}].
   Type: \code{[double]}.
 }

 \item{year}{
   year when the pipe (i.e. acceptor's incoming edge) is put in operation after
   laying or total overhaul.
   Type: \code{[integerish]}
 }

 \item{insulation}{
    Identifier of insulation that covers the exterior of pipe (i.e. acceptor's
    incoming edge):
    \describe{
      \item{\code{0}}{no insulation}
      \item{\code{1}}{foamed polyurethane or analogue}
      \item{\code{2}}{polymer concrete}
    }
   Type: \code{[integerish, subset]}.
 }

 \item{laying}{
    Type of pipe laying depicting the position of pipe in space. Only five
    types of pipe laying are considered:
    \itemize{
      \item \code{air},
      \item \code{channel},
      \item \code{room},
      \item \code{tunnel},
      \item \code{underground}.
    }
    Type: \code{[character, subset]}.
  }

 \item{beta}{
   Logical indicator: should they consider additional heat losses of fittings
   located on this pipe (i.e. acceptor's incoming edge)?
   Type: \code{[logical]}.
 }

 \item{exp5k}{
    Logical indicator for regime of pipe (i.e. acceptor's incoming edge): if
    \code{TRUE} pipe is operated more that \code{5000} hours per year.
    Type: \code{[logical]}.
  }

 \item{roughness}{
   Roughness of internal wall of pipe (i.e. acceptor's incoming edge),
   [\emph{m}].
   Type: \code{[double]}.
 }

 \item{inlet}{
    Elevation of pipe inlet, [\emph{m}].
    Type: \code{[double]}.
 }

 \item{outlet}{
    Elevation of pipe outlet, [\emph{m}].
    Type: \code{[double]}.
 }

\description{
Data describes a virtual test bench of branched district heating network
by exposing parameters associated with
\href{http://docs.cntd.ru/document/902148459}{Minenergo Order 325}.
They treat data as a snapshot of network state and use it
primarily for static thermal-hydraulic computations and topology effects.
}
\details{
The test bench has the next configuration:

\figure{m325testbench.png}

As it may be seen from the figure there is a particularity in topology of
the provided directed graph: each node has only single ancestor. Hence one
of isomorphic representation of such directed graph is a
\code{\link{data.frame}} in which each row describes a node along with its
incoming edge and each column contains an attribute value for that node or
an attribute value for its incoming edge.

Since they deal with incoming edges and hence nodes are all flow acceptors
the natural enumeration of nodes is by acceptor id.

Note that to leverage
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraph/index.html}{igraph}
functionality for plotting there is a zero sender of flow.
