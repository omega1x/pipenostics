\description{
Calculate failure pressure of the corroded pipe according to \emph{PCORRC}
 model.

 \emph{PCORRC} methodology was developed on the basis of studying the
 mechanism of destruction of pipes, material of which has improved or high
 fracture toughness, and on the high-precision modeling of the finite element
 pipe models performed at the \emph{Battelle Institute}. According to field
 test results of a large number of actual pipe segments, the destruction
 mechanism for defective pipeline segment depends on the pipe material
 fracture toughness. These tests also showed that only pipes made out of
 steel with improved or high fracture toughness fail a result of plastic
 fracture. In determining the \emph{Folias} factor the effect of increased
 stress concentration and steel hardening in the plastic deformation zone at
 the start of the defect failure process was taken into account.

 This code should be applied only to
 \itemize{
   \item a single cross section of the pipeline containing a longitudinally
         oriented, flat bottom surface defect of the corrosion/erosion type;
   \item pipelines, which operate at temperatures exceeding the temperature
         of pipe material ductileâ€“brittle transition, and for pipematerial
         with the impact energy of Charpy 61 [\emph{J}] and above.
