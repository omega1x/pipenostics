\description{
Trace values of thermal-hydraulic regime (temperature, pressure,
 flow rate, and other) in the bunched pipeline along the flow direction using
 norms of heat loss values prescribed by
 \href{https://docs.cntd.ru/document/902148459}{Minenergo Order 325}.
}
\details{
The calculated (values of) regime may be considered as representation of
 district heating process in conditions of hypothetically perfect
 technical state of pipe walls and insulation.

 They consider the topology of district heating network represented by
 \code{\link{m325nxdata}}:

 \figure{m325tracefw.png}

 Tracing starts from sensor-equipped root node and goes forward, i.e along
 the flow direction. Function \code{\link{m325traceline}} serves under the
 hood for tracing identified linear segments from root node to every
 terminal node. Hence they only need root node to be equipped with sensors.
 Sensors at other nodes are redundant in forward tracing, since the tracing
 algorithm by no means consider them for tracing.

 Moreover in the forward tracing algorithm they assume the flow of heat
 carrier is distributed proportionally to the cross-sectional area of the
 outgoing pipeline. Actually, a lot of reasons may cause significant
 deviations from this assumption. As a result, the sequence of paired
 backward/forward tracing may be divergent for regime parameters.

 Though some input arguments are natively vectorized their individual values
 all relate to common part of district heating network, i.e. associated with
 common object. It is due to isomorphism between vector representation and
 directed graph of this network. For more details of isomorphic topology
 description see \code{\link{m325nxdata}}.

 They are welcome to couple the algorithm with functionality of
 \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=data.table}{data.table}.

 Optional verification of pipe diameters and wall thicknesses is performed
 against \code{\link{b36pipedata}} data.

# Minimum two nodes should be in district heating network graph:
m325tracefw(verbose = FALSE)

# Consider isomorphic representation of District Heating Network graph:
DHN <- m325nxdata

# * avoid using numeric identifiers for nodes:
DHN$sender   <- sprintf("N\%02i", DHN$sender)
DHN$acceptor <- sprintf("N\%02i", DHN$acceptor)

# Perform backward tracing to get regime on root node:
bw_report <- do.call("m325tracebw", c(as.list(DHN), verbose = FALSE))

# Put the traced values to the root node of test bench:
root_node_idx <- 12
root_node <- sprintf("N\%02i", root_node_idx)
regime_param  <- c("temperature", "pressure", "flow_rate")
DHN[root_node_idx, regime_param] <-
  subset(bw_report,
         node == root_node & aggregation == "median",
         regime_param)
rm(root_node, root_node_idx)

# Trace the test bench forward for the first time:
fw_report <- do.call(
  "m325tracefw", c(as.list(DHN), verbose = FALSE, elev_tol = .5)

# Let's compare traced regime at terminal nodes back to test bench:
report <- subset(
  rbind(bw_report, fw_report),
  node \%in\% subset(DHN, !(acceptor \%in\% sender))$acceptor &
    aggregation == "identity"

# To address the problem of possible norm losses of the heat carrier,
# they could roughly define the leaks as follows:
DHN[, "a"] <- 0.0025 * (365 - 90) / 365

# so that forward tracing
fw_report_loss <- do.call(
  "m325tracefw", c(as.list(DHN), verbose = FALSE, elev_tol = .5)

# produces slightly different results [kcal/m/h]:
