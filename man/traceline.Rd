\details{
They consider only simple tracing paths which do not contain rings and any
 kind of parallelization. At the same time bidirectional (forward and
 backward) tracing is possible in accordance with sensor position. They also
 may consider discharges to network at the inlet of each pipeline segment
 as an approximation of actual forks of flows. Relevant illustration of
 adopted assumptions for 4-segment tracing path is depicted on the next
 figure.

 They make additional check for consistency of \code{inlet} and \code{outlet}
 values for subsequent pipe segments. Discrepancy of appropriate elevations
 cannot be more than \code{elev_tol}.

 Since inner diameter of the pipe is used as input, the the thickness of the
 pipe wall additionally considered in heat flux calculations. Pipe wall thickness
 is derived from pipe diameter using
 \href{https://docs.cntd.ru/document/1200174717}{GOST 30732} specifications.
