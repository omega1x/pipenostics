\description{
Trace values of thermal-hydraulic regime (temperature, pressure,
 flow rate, and other) in the bunched pipeline against the flow direction using
 user-provided values of \emph{specific heat loss power}.

 Algorithm also suits for partially measurable district heating network with
 massive data lack conditions, when there are no temperature and pressure
 sensor readings on the majority of terminal nodes.
}
\details{
They consider the topology of district heating network represented by
 \code{\link{m325testbench}}:

 \figure{m325tracebw0.png}

 The network may be partially sensor-equipped too:
 
 \figure{m325tracebwp.png}

 In latter case no more than two nodes must be equipped with pressure and temperature
 sensors whereas for other nodes only flow rate sensors must be installed.

 Tracing starts from sensor-equipped nodes and goes backwards, i.e against
 the flow direction.

 Though some input arguments are natively vectorized their individual values
 all relate to common part of district heating network, i.e. associated with
 common object. It is due to isomorphism between vector representation and
 directed graph of this network. For more details of isomorphic topology
 description see \code{\link{m325testbench}}.

 Before tracing starts for the next node, previously calculated values of
 thermal-hydraulic parameters are aggregated by either averaging or
 by median. The latter seems more robust for avoiding strong influence of
 possible outliers which may come from actual heating transfer anomalies,
 erroneous sensor readings or wrong pipeline specifications.

 Aggregation for values of flow rate at the node is always \code{\link{sum}}.
