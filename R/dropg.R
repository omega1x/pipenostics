#' @description
#'  Calculate \emph{drop} or \emph{recovery} of flow rate in pipe using
#'  geometric factors.
#'
#'  The calculated value may be positive or negative. When it is positive they
#'  have the \emph{drop}, i.e. the decrease of flow rate in the outlet of pipe
#'  under consideration. When the calculated value is negative they have the
#'  \emph{recovery}, i.e. the increase of flow rate in the outlet of pipe under
#'  consideration. In both cases to calculate flow rate on the outlet of pipe
#'  under consideration simply subtract the calculated value from the
#'  sensor-measured flow rate on the inlet.
#'
#' @param adj
#'  diameters of adjacent pipes through which discharges to and recharges from
#'  network occur, [\emph{mm}].
#'
#'  Types:
#'
#'  \describe{
#'    \item{\code{\link{assert_double}}}{
#'      total diameter of all adjacent pipes (total diameter case)}
#'    \item{\code{\link{assert_list}} of \code{\link{assert_double}}}{a set of
#'       diameters of adjacent pipes (particular diameter case)}
#'  }
#'
#'  Positive values of diameters of adjacent pipes correspond to discharging
#'  process through those pipe, whereas negative values of diameters mean
#'  recharging. See \strong{Details} and \strong{Examples} for further explanations.
#'
#' @param d
#'   diameter of pipe under consideration, [\emph{mm}]. Type: \code{\link{assert_double}}.
#'
#' @param flow_rate
#'   sensor-measured amount of heat carrier (water) that is transferred through
#'   the inlet of pipe during a period, [\emph{ton/hour}]. Type: \code{\link{assert_double}}.
#'
#' @return
#'  flow rate \emph{drop} or \emph{recovery} at the outlet of pipe,
#'  [\emph{ton/hour}], numeric vector. The value is positive for \emph{drop},
#'  whereas for \emph{recovery} it is negative. In both cases to calculate
#'  flow rate on the outlet of pipe under consideration simply subtract the
#'  calculated value from the sensor-measured flow rate on the inlet.
#'  Type: \code{\link{assert_double}}.
#'
#' @details
#'  It is common that sensor-measured flow rate undergoes discharges to
#'  network and recharges from it. For calculation of flow rate \emph{drop} or
#'  \emph{recovery} the next configuration of district heating network segment is
#'  assumed:
#'
#'  \figure{dropg.png}
#'
#'  Usually, there are no additional sensors that could measure flow rate in
#'  each flow fork. In that case they only may operate with geometric
#'  factors, i.e. assuming that flow rate is proportional to square of pipe
#'  diameter.
#'
#'  The simple summation of flow rates over all adjacent pipes produces
#'  the required flow rate \emph{drop} or \emph{recovery} located on the
#'  outlet of the pipe under consideration. Since there is concurrency between
#'  discharges and recharges the diameters of discharge pipes are regarded
#'  positive whereas diameters of recharge pipes must be negative.
#'
#'  Be careful when dealing with geometric factors for large amount of recharges
#'  from network: there are no additional physical constraints and thus the
#'  calculated value of \emph{recovery} may have non-sense.
